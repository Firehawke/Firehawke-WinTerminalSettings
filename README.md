# What?

This is my customized Windows Terminal settings. This includes a colorset I've
created called FH-VGA, which is designed to mimic the colors used by most VGA
cards of the 1990s.

# What's not included?

No images are included. The ones I'm using are of different licenses and can't
be put in a repository together. You'll need to come up with your own pictures
to use in the background or remove the background lines entirely.

# How do I use this?

Clone the repository or download the `settings.js` on file. Open up your text
editor of choice, then copy the parts you want to the `settings.json` file in
your Windows Terminal config folder. You can get to that by going into
Settings (Ctrl-Comma); it'll open up your settings in a text editor.

Make any changes you need to make, save, and your Windows Terminal will be
instantly changed.

# Where do I add pictures?

Put them in the same folder where `settings.json` is.
